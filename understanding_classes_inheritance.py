-notes on https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html
-how does inheritance work e.g. putting the parent class into the child class parentheses; when the class object is constructed the base class is remembered, so if e.g. a method is not found in the child then next step is to search it in the parent class; it is possible to overwrite the parent class method by using the same name
-what are ABCs (abstract base classes) => you can use them to get the methods of those classes I believe
-see 9.5.1 on multiple inheritance, but let me jump over that for know
see 9.6. for convention on private variables
