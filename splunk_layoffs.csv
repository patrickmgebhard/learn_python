2/1/2023 11:28:48,April,Wright,Sr Security Architect,SGS Security Architecture,Boston area,Remote Only,https://architectsecurity.org,"I have: 
- Media training
- Soft Skills
- Experience in various formats of writing (blog, formal, news articles) and copy editing
- Experience giving in-person and online training
- Strong background in:
--- GRC
--- Privacy
--- SDLC processes
- No issue with working long-term, odd hours that accommodate global organizational timezones
- Management experience (though I prefer IC)

I'd love to move into a full time ""security awareness"" program role. Even if it were only one part of a broader role. 

Going back into GRC is also a very reasonable next step for me

I've had at least some past experience doing almost everything in infosec (NOT pen testing, malware analysis, and threat hunting). I started as a UNIX admin and app dev (perl, php, shell, C, pascal, basic, hypercard...)

I'm comfortable in *NIX command line, and reviewing settings in enterprise apps, but I'm not a ""hands-on"" engineer or a dev anymore

My focus is on people and process. Proactive risk mitigation, shifting security left, overarching processes, providing guidance and consultation on a myriad of topics, writing policies, etc. I'm great at explaining very complex security topics in simple ways that non-infosec people can understand.

anyway, it's been a pleasure, friends! <3"
